<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>
    When you log in, 1 cookie will be used by CF Imager.
</p>
<p>
    It allows us to authenticate you. It also allows us to track you, see the #Tracking section.
</p>
<h2>Passwords</h2>
<p>
    Any password typed into the password fields of the <a href="../login">login</a> and
    <a href="../register">register</a> pages are immediately hashed before they are sent to the server. This means that
    an attacker listening between you and our server could not see your password, but he'd still be to login as you,
    only on our website (and not on other websites on which you share the same password).
</p>
<p>
    Yet, you should try to use a unique password for every website you use.
    This first hash is using the following function: <br/>
    hashClient = argon2id(password=[password], salt="vXA2vPiUeWjSzlx1kLFM9VyRXfIbSoBnTqVMQ2jlM5e6VW5hDCRPZTPWP49EsUcO",
    time=1, mem=16MB, hashLen=64, parallelism=1)
</p>
<p>
    When you hashed password is received by the server, it is hashed another time, with a unique salt and compare to our
    database. This way, even if an attacker had access to our database, he could not see your password, nor he could
    log in as you.
</p>
<p>
    The server-side hashing is the following:<br/>
    hashServer = argon2id(password=[hashClient], salt=[unique salt for each user],
    time=4, mem=128MB, hashLen=64, parallelism=8)
</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
    As of 2020's knowledge of cryptography and computing power, there is no way for an attacker to get your password,
    even with access
    to our database, if you password is strong enough. It is still a great idea to have a unique password for CF Imager.
</p>
<p>
    Yet, it is plausible that an error on our side could allow someone to log to your account without your password.
    This means your should not store any sensible data on your CF Imager account.
</p>
<h2>Mailing</h2>
<p>
    Your email address is used as a way to verify your identity. Getting access to your email address grants access to
    your CF Imager account.
</p>
<p>
    Your email can be used to warn you of security breaches, verify your identity or tell you about the
    advancement of this project.
</p>
<p>
    Your email will never be shared without your explicit consent.
</p>
<h2>Tracking</h2>
<h3>As an anonymous user</h3>
<p>
    Every single time a file is requested from our server, we store the IP which asked for it, the error code if there
    was one and the length of the file sent. This allows us to track you. But we are not doing so, this data is only
    used for issue troubleshooting and bug fixing.
</p>
<h3>When logged in</h3>
<p>
    When you are logged in, a unique account ID is assigned to you. It is sent to the server for every single page
    you browse on cfimager.neirpyc.ovh . This theoretically allows us to track every single actions you do.
</p>
<p>
    Yet, we are only gathering data to improve our service, and they are never shared. We store your IP address,
    the error code and the content length of every file you request from our server. In case an error occurs, the date,
    and the full request body (we strip out passwords) is stored to our log files, so we can find the issue and fix it.
</p>
<p>
    None of these data are automatically processed (they are just sorted by error kind).
</p>
<h2>Data access and rectification</h2>
<p>
    There is, so far, now way to automatically view, modify or erase your data. If you need to, you can get in touch at
    contact@cfimager.neirpyc.ovh .
